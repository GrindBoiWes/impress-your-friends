# impress-your-friends
Find the perfect meal and drink to impress your friends!


# Description
After a long day, sometimes you don't want to stress over what you want to cook.Or maybe, you're hosting some friends and you can't decide what meal you want to make for your guests.. Now you're in luck! With this app, the possibilities are endless! 

This app is meant to serve as a one-shop-stop to help you figure out what sounds best to you. You will be shown a variety of food items based off of "fill once project is done". Your selected item will show you the meal, the ingredients, as well as brief description of how to prep and cook that meal. The possibilities will be endless. But what else goes great with a great meal? A nice stiff cocktail! You will also be able to search for any drink based off of "fill once project is complete". Maybe you don't feel like searching for a bunch of food or drinks though. With the random button generator, it will spit out a new recipe for you on each click. Afterwards, you will be able to save each food item and call back to it at any point!
